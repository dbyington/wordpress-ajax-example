wordpress-ajax-example

========================

This is purely an example, with lots of comments, to help me and others better understand how to do AJAX calls in WordPress plugins and widgets with jQuery.

I invite your comments. Comment on anything, really! If you have comments on how I could have done something better, or worse let me know. At the same time I am trying to improve my coding style, so please, please, please let me know what you think.
